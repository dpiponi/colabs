        "\n",
        "Here is a simple Haskell function that makes use of the list monad to implement non-determinism.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "f x y z = do\n",
        "  u <- x\n",
        "  v <- (2 *) <$> y\n",
        "  w <- (v +) <$> z\n",
        "  return $ u * v + w\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "For those not familiar with the Haskell list monad, the code draws `u` from each element of `x` in turn, then draws `v` from each element of `y` (multiplied by 2) in turn, and then draws `w` from `v` plus each element of z in turn. At the end, all of the values of `u * v + w` are collected into a single flat list. (In fact, it's similar to a Python list comprehension, which was derived from Haskell's.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is a Python function that does the same:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "def f(x, y, z):\n",

        "But importantly, it runs on the GPU and draws from `u`, `v` and `w` in parallel.\n",
        "\n",
        "How can it possibly do that? It requires running the portion of code after the `u = ...` once for each value of `u`.\n",
        "This means `amb` must be affecting the control flow of the following lines.\n",
        "Haskell has monads and do-notation for this, but Python has no obvious mechanism to allow an expression to change subsequent control flow.\n",

        "Well here's the path I'm going to take:\n",
        "I'm going to use the GPU numerics compiler [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax).\n",
        "As described at its web site\n",
        "> \"At its core, JAX is an extensible system for transforming numerical functions. Here are four of primary interest: grad, jit, vmap, and pmap\"\n",
        "\n",
        "so it's perfect for this task.\n",
        "I'm going to implement something close to effect handling for it  (à la [Bauer et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6316)).\n",
        "(I'll sketch what \"effect handling\" means for us below.)\n",
        "But implementing, or even just modifying compilers isn't easy.\n",
        "So instead I'm going to modify an interpreter and then use a trick simpler than the [Futamura projections](http://blog.sigfpe.com/2009/05/three-projections-of-doctor-futamura.html) to turn the interpreter into a compiler.\n",
        "\n",
        "# A sketch of how it's going to work\n",
        "Don't take the following too literally. It's really just a sketch of how the code works.\n",
        "In particular I'm using notational abuse to say that $f=g$ means that the Python functions $f$ and $g$ are extensionally equal in the sense that applying $f$ to $x$ and applying $g$ to $x$ give the same result even though $f$ and $g$ may be implemented differently and in fact may even run on different hardware.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's the idea: suppose we have\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   a magic \"decompiler\" function $T$ that can turn a Python function into an abstract syntax tree (AST) representing the code\n",
        "2.   an interpreter $I$ that can interpret an AST, in effect turning it back into a Python function.\n",
        "3.   a compiler, $C$, that can compile an AST, except that the result runs on the GPU.\n",

        "\n",
        "Note that $C(T(I(T(f))))$ is a Python-to-GPU compiler.\n",
        "\n",
        "And now comes the trick: if $I'$ is another interpreter, for example one that supports effect handling, then $C(T(I'(T(f))))$ compiles $f$ for the GPU with support for effect handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "Jax is designed to work on data in the form of \"tensors\". So $T$ can't take arbitrary functions as arguments. It can only work on functions that are ultimately built from the kinds of function that are found in the `numpy` library.\n",

        "This method is very flexible. You can implement a wide array of handlers including readers, writers, state, debugging tools, [sow/reap](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/oryx/notebooks/a_tour_of_oryx) and probability. In many ways it's more flexible than Haskell monads and you have some freedom with types that Haskell doesn't give you.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the negative side Jax needs to be able to determine all tensor sizes and types statically. So in a fragment of code like\n",
        "```\n",
        "a <- amb(...)\n",
        "b <- amb(...a...)\n",
        "```\n",
        "it's perfectly fine for the argument to the second amb to depend on the value of `a`, but its shape can't depend on the value of `a`. For similar reasons you can't implement Haskell's `guard` function because that would dynamically change the size of a tensor. (But maybe you could probably build a tensor of flags and plumb that through the code in a way that a user doesn't see it.)\n",
        "\n",
        "And another caveat is that in the interests of brevity I skipped some things. Jax can work with data more structured than pure tensors. You can work with Python objects that contain tensors, such as lists, tuples, or your own types. The extra structure is removed before the data goes to the GPU and is put back afterwards. I have ignored this.\n",
        "\n",
        "The function `amb` is named after a related function invented by John McCarthy who invented Lisp. [Here](http://www.randomhacks.net/2005/10/11/amb-operator/)'s where I first learnt about it. The version I describe above doesn't use backtracking and runs all paths.\n",
