Some colabs

* [Branched Flow](https://github.com/dpiponi/colabs/blob/main/Copy_of_Branched_flow.ipynb) It's fun to send light through disordered media. At the right scale you get a nice balance between directed paths and completely random walks.

* [Top Left of Inverse](https://github.com/dpiponi/colabs/blob/main/Copy_of_Top_Left_of_Inverse.ipynb) See [Bohemian Matrix Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07769) for more details and an explanation for why this is the top left of an inverse.

* [Smoothed Hofstadter](https://github.com/dpiponi/colabs/blob/main/Smoothed_Hofstadter.ipynb) You may know Hofstadter's Butterfly from Godel, Escher, Bach. They're not hard to render but it took me a while to figure out how to render them "smoothly" with nicely interpolated colours.

* [Analytic Signals for Audio and Radio Pitch Shifting](https://github.com/dpiponi/colabs/blob/main/Copy_of_Analytic_Signals_for_Audio_and_Radio_pitch_shifting.ipynb)
* [Stochastic Calculus Examples](https://github.com/dpiponi/colabs/blob/main/Copy_of_Stochastic_Calculus_Examples_Shared.ipynb)
* [Handling Effects with Jax](https://github.com/dpiponi/colabs/blob/main/Handling_Effects_with_Jax_(Public_version).ipynb) I have a trick, a bit like the Futumura projection, that allows you to add effects to a compiler (such as Jax) but only requiring you to write an interpreter for those effects.
* [Inverse Radon Transform](https://github.com/dpiponi/colabs/blob/main/Inverse_Radon_transform_using_Tensorflow_derivative_adjoint_trick.ipynb) The basic algorithm used in Computer Aided Tomography. Kind of a baby version of Neural Radiance Fields and the like.
* [Simulating Plucked Strings with TensorFlow](https://github.com/dpiponi/colabs/blob/main/Simulating_Plucked_Strings_with_TensorFlow.ipynb) The Karplus-Strong model is a popular one for synthesizing string sounds but it uses linear filters that look inherently serial. Here's a trick for running them in parallel on a GPU.
* [Trapezium rule with complex numbers](https://github.com/dpiponi/colabs/blob/main/Trapezium_rule_with_complex_numbers.ipynb) Using the trapezium rule to integrate a highly oscillatory integral that looks intractable.
